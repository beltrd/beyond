          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the mutual promises and undertakings contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:</p>

        <p>1.2 “Confidential Information” means information that:</p>
        <p>a. is by its nature confidential;</p>
        <p>b. is designated in writing by Licensor as confidential;</p>

          literary or
          artistic field and any application or right to apply for registration of any of these rights and any right to protect or enforce any of these rights, as further specified in clause 5.</p>

            PandaTip: The “purpose” (or “permitted use”) is a very important part of any license since it bounds the Licensee to specific use. Any other use will require separate negotiation of a separate license fee.</p>

          <p>4.2 The Licensee may permit its employees to use the Asset for the purposes described in Item 8, provided that the Licensee takes all necessary steps and imposes the necessary conditions to ensure that all employees using the Asset do
            not
            commercialize or disclose the contents of it to any third person, or use it other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

          <p>5.1 All Intellectual Property Rights over and in respect of the Asset are owned by Licensor. The Licensee does not acquire any rights of ownership in the Asset.</p>

            Agreement,
            or
            any use of the Asset by the Licensee or its employees; and Licensee hereby releases Licensor to the fullest extent from any such liability, loss, damage or claim.</p>
          <h2>7. CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>

            a. is required to be disclosed according to the requirements of any law, judicial or legislative body or government agency; or
            b. was approved for release in writing by the other Party, but only to the extent of and subject to such conditions as may be imposed in such written authorization.</p>
          <p>7.3 This clause 7 will survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
          <h2>8. DISCLAIMERS & RELEASE</h2>

          <p>8.1 To the extent permitted by law, Licensor will in no way be liable to the Licensee or any third party for any loss or damage, however caused (including through negligence) which may be directly or indirectly suffered in connection
            with any
            use of
            the Asset.</p>
          <p>8.2 The Asset is provided by Licensor on an “as is” basis.
            PandaTip: By using the words “as is” you limit your liability for any claims the Licensee might make with respect to the Asset (that is, the item you are licensing). The point here is that the Licensee has seen the item in action, and
            that you
            are allowing them to use it, but are not making any guarantees.</p>

          <p>8.3 Licensor will not be held liable by the Licensee in any way, for any loss, damage or injury suffered by the Licensee or by any other person related to any use of the Asset or any part thereof.</p>

            programs.</p>
          <p>8.5 Licensor does not warrant that the Asset will function in any environment.</p>
          <p>8.6 The Licensee acknowledges that:</p>
          <p>a. The Asset has not been prepared to meet any specific requirements of any party, including any requirements of Licensee; and</p>
          <p>b. it is therefore the responsibility of the Licensee to ensure that the Asset meets its own individual requirements.</p>
          <p>8.7 To the extent permitted by law, no express or implied warranty, term, condition or undertaking is given or assumed by Licensor, including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
          <h2>9. INDEMNITY</h2>

          <p>9.1 The Licensee must indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor, its board members, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims (including third party claims), demands, actions, suits, expenses (including
            attorney’s
            fees)
            and damages (including indirect or consequential loss) resulting in any way from:</p>
          <p>a. Licensee’s and Licensee’s employee’s use or reliance on the Asset,</p>
          <p>b. any breach of the terms of this License Agreement by the Licensee or any Licensee employee, and</p>
          <p>c. any other act of Licensee.</p>
          <p>9.2 This clause 9 will survive termination of this Agreement.</p>

            waiver
            thereof.</p>
          <h2>11. GOVERNING LAW</h2>

          <p>11.1 This Agreement will be construed by and governed in accordance with the laws of Canada. The Parties submit to exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Canada.
            PandaTip: If the Agreement is to be governed in accordance with U.S. laws, then you will need to provide the State also.</p>

          <h2>12. TERMINATION</h2>

          <p>12.1 This Agreement and the license granted herein commences upon the Commencement Date and is granted for the Term, unless otherwise terminated by Licensor in the event of any of the following:</p>
          <p>a. if the Licensee is in breach of any term of this License Agreement and has not corrected such breach to Licensor’s reasonable satisfaction within 7 days of Licensor’s notice of the same;</p>
          <p>b. if the Licensee becomes insolvent, or institutes (or there is instituted against it) proceedings in bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or dissolution, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or</p>
          <p>c. the Licensee is in breach of clause 5 or 7 of this Agreement.</p>
